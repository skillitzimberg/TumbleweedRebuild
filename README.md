## Description
TumbleweedRebuild is a rebuild of the Tumbleweed Bakehouse website my team made with C#. I'm rebuilding the frontend in React and will have a C# API backend. The core focus of the project in terms of my capstone is the admin side.

## Capstone Proposal
Name of Project: Tumbleweed Bakehouse  

**Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:** Essentially this is a Point of Sale system. It will allow admin users to manage customers, orders, and products. If time allows, I want to make it a website/e-commerce site where customers can place advance orders for pick up.

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

* admin can create, edit, delete, hide & show products
* admin can create, edit, delete customers
* admin can create, edit, delete orders

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

* React
* Redux
* Jest
* Babel
* Webpack
* Node/NPM
* Firebase or some persistence


**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

* Admin can track product sales
* Customers can view products
* Customers can place orders
* SQL
* C# API
* Secure database
* Live hosting

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

I don't know yet.
